### ðŸ“’What I learned today?

- I reviewed some basic knowledge about HTML tags. From what I understood, other students had already learned this last week, so maybe the professor was just giving us a practice exercise. I also learned about CSS, which is used with HTML tags. There are several ways to use CSS with HTML, but today we only covered the basics.

- I forgot exactly how many `<h~>` tags there are, but I learned that the heading tags range from `<h1>` to `<h6>`.

- I used to be confused between the `<p></p>` tag and the `<pre></pre>` tag, but now I know the difference. The `<p>` tag is a block-level element (not inline) that creates a paragraph and takes up the full width of its container. The `<pre>` tag, on the other hand, preserves both whitespace and line breaks, so the text appears exactly as it is written in the code editor.

- The professor said that using px is not recommended because it sets a fixed font size that does not adapt to different devices. Instead, she suggested using % for font-size. However, I think using rem might be a better option. I should look into which one is more appropriate.

- If I want to apply multiple styles inside an inline style attribute, I need to separate them with a semicolon ;.

`<tagname style="color: red; font-size: 1.2rem;">`

### ðŸŒŸMy comment

The professor used Notepad as the code editor, but I found it very inconvenient, so I switched to VS Code. I think I should also study more about the fundamental concepts of the web, such as how a web browser works.
