            Student ambassador 27th in Duksung Women’s University
          </summary>
          <p>
            Through my experience as a member of the “Bitnaemi” student
            ambassador team, I learned many valuable lessons. I gained a deeper
            understanding of how a large organization operates and developed a
            strong sense of responsibility for my work. As Vice President, I
            overcame my fear of speaking in front of others and cultivated
            attention to detail by providing final feedback on all content
            before publication. Since every post required approval from the
            president and vice president, I took great care to ensure that no
            inaccurate information was shared with students. This experience
            taught me to stay organized, review everything thoroughly, and
            approach all tasks with responsibility, diligence, and precision.
            Additionally, as a member of both the SNS and Design Teams, I became
            familiar with managing social media posts and designing card news
            using Canva. Because our mission was to promote the university, I
            consistently thought about how to represent our school in the best
            light—both internally and externally. Internally, I focused on
            sharing useful information with fellow students, while externally, I
            worked to highlight the strengths of our university to a broader
            audience. As a result of these efforts, our Instagram account
            surpassed 400 followers within one year, which was a rewarding
            achievement.

            Grand Prize, 2022 Duksung Women’s University IT Engineering
            Hackathon
          </summary>
          <p>
            It was my first experience in collaboration — a hackathon. Duksung
            Women’s University operates an academic system where students
            explore various majors during their first year, so I only began
            learning my major courses as a sophomore. At the time of the
            hackathon, the knowledge I had was limited to what I learned in the
            first semester of my second year. The only practical experience I
            had was creating prototype screens using Adobe XD, and I didn’t even
            fully understand how the screens I designed were actually
            implemented through development. Nevertheless, I joined the
            hackathon with a spirit of challenge, determined to try anything.
            Despite the difficulties, I did my best. Our team consisted of four
            members — I was the only designer, and the other three were
            developers. The hackathon lasted for a week, and on Wednesday
            morning, one of the developers had to leave the project due to
            personal reasons. Because of this, it became difficult for the
            development team to continue with our original app idea, so we
            decided to switch to one of our earlier ideas. Since I was more
            familiar with mobile apps, designing a course registration website
            was a new challenge for me. Still, I did my best by researching
            various references. Although our communication between design and
            development wasn’t perfect, the experience was very meaningful as my
            first collaboration, and I was able to fully immerse myself in the
            project within a short time.

          <p>
            The first project was a collaboration with a company called Ecube
            Labs, where we were assigned to define problems in the company’s
            service and design wireframes as a task. Through this second
            collaborative experience, I realized the importance of clearly
            defining problems and the value of logical, well-reasoned planning
            and design. This project allowed me to experience collaboration with
            planners to the fullest extent. The second project was a meet-up
            project where participants selected their own topics and developed a
            web or mobile app over the course of about three months. Our team
            planned and developed a financial challenge app called “Tikkle”,
            targeting people in their 20s who wish to reflect on their spending
            habits, record their consumption, share their progress with others,
            and build sustainable financial habits. I was in charge of design,
            and through this third genuine collaboration, I came to understand
            what it means for the screens I design to be actually implemented by
            the frontend. Although my design skills were still developing,
            receiving practical feedback helped me deepen my understanding of
            design. It was also my first time using Figma, and I came to
            appreciate the usefulness of components. However, due to time
            constraints, I felt that the overall completeness of the project
            could have been higher.

            It was my first experience collaborating on web development within a
            club. I learned the basics of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, as well as
            the fundamentals of React. Through this project, I also connected to
            an API for the first time.

          <p>
            I participated in the hackathon as a frontend developer, taking
            charge of planning, design, and web publishing. The given themes
            were “work” and “run,” and our team chose to work on the “run”
            theme. At first, some team members didn’t seem very engaged, but by
            taking initiative and leading the project proactively, I was able to
            motivate the team and bring everyone together. Although it was one
            of my first experiences designing for the web, I dedicated myself
            fully and did my best to create a polished result.
